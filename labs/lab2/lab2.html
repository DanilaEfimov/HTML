                        Hello, World!
                        My name is Danila
                        I'm from Russia and would I visit states it will be Washington,
                        because I always was interested what different between capital of
                        states, where no such more people living, and New York (kids in
                        Russia think that it's capital of states)
                        I have two brothers (I'm 18 years old): older is 18 years (Egor)
                        and younger is 8 (Matvey).
                        I don't remember last time when I was crying, but think that it
                        could when Egor leave me, when he started to studing at Kazan.
                        P.S. It's really my massege text from one of letters what I'd wrote
                        in that letter I've answered to other letter from chat USA-friend
